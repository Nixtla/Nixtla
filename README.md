# Nixtla - Machine learning for time series forecasting



## Currently available models

* [Exponential Smoothing Recurrent Neural Network (ESRNN)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207019301153), a hybrid model that combines the expressivity of non linear models to capture the trends while it normalizes using a Holt-Winters inspired model for the levels and seasonals.  This model is the winner of the M4 forecasting competition.

* [Neural Basis Expansion Analysis with Exogenous Variables (NBEATSX)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10437) is a model from Element-AI (Yoshua Bengioâ€™s lab) that has proven to achieve state of the art performance on benchmark large scale forecasting datasets like Tourism, M3, and M4. The model is fast to train an has an interpretable configuration.
